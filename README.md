# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
   parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
   },
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list



-----------------------Explaination of userForm component-------------------------
Explanation of the code:

Import Statements: The component imports the necessary React components from the Material-UI library: TextField for input fields and Button for buttons.

Functional Component: UserForm is a functional component that takes two props: user and onSave.

State Management: Within the component, there are two pieces of local state managed using the useState hook:

name: Represents the user's name input.
email: Represents the user's email input.
Form Submission: The handleSubmit function is triggered when the form is submitted. It prevents the default form submission behavior and creates a new user object based on the input fields. The onSave prop is then called with the new user object as an argument.

Form Structure: The JSX code defines the structure of the form:

Two TextField components for entering the user's name and email.
Each TextField has a value attribute that binds it to the corresponding state (name or email).
The onChange event handlers update the state values based on user input.
A Button component with the label "Save" is used to submit the form.
Component Export: The UserForm component is exported as the default export, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

In summary, the UserForm component is a reusable form component that allows users to enter their name and email. It can be used for creating new users or editing existing user information. The onSave prop allows you to define what happens when the form is submitted, such as saving the user data to a database or updating the UI.




---------------------------------------explaination of Second Page--------------------------------------------

Imports and Dependencies:

The component imports React hooks (useEffect, useState), the useNavigate hook from the react-router-dom package, and components from the @mui/x-data-grid library.
The component imports a local CSS file named SecondPage.css to style its contents.
State and Effect:

The component uses the useState hook to manage the data state, which holds an array of posts.
The component fetches data from the URL 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts' using the fetch API inside the useEffect hook. The fetched data is stored in the data state.
The useEffect hook also checks for the presence of user details in the localStorage. If user details are not present, it alerts the user and navigates them back to the home page ('/').
DataGrid Component:

The component renders a data grid using the DataGrid component from the @mui/x-data-grid library. It displays the fetched posts with columns for ID, User ID, Title, and Body.
The rows prop of the DataGrid component is set to the data state, which populates the rows of the grid.
The columns prop defines the column structure and headers for the grid.
Handle Logout Functionality:

The handleLogout function removes user details from the localStorage when the "Logout" button is clicked.
After removing user details, it uses the useNavigate hook to navigate the user back to the UserForm page ('/').
Rendering:

The component renders a container (div) with a class name of second-page-container.
It displays a welcome header, a "Logout" button, the data grid, and the DepartmentList component below.
Styling:

The component's appearance is styled using CSS classes from the imported SecondPage.css file. Styling includes positioning, sizing, colors, and fonts.
Overall, the SecondPage component serves as a page where users are redirected after successful login. It fetches and displays posts using a data grid, provides a "Logout" button to log out the user, and includes the DepartmentList component at the bottom. The styling ensures a visually appealing layout for the page.




----------------------------------------------explaination of Departmentjsx--------------------------------------------------------------------



The DepartmentList component you've provided seems to be a user interface element designed to display a list of departments and their sub-departments with selection functionality using checkboxes. Let's break down its key features and functionality:

Imports and Dependencies:

The component imports necessary dependencies from the @mui/material package, such as List, ListItem, ListItemButton, ListItemIcon, ListItemText, Collapse, and Checkbox.
It also imports the icons ExpandLess and ExpandMore from @mui/icons-material.
The component imports a local CSS file named DepartmentList.css to style its contents.
Data Structure:

The initialDepartments array contains department objects, each having an id, name, and an array of subDepartments.
State Management:

The component uses the useState hook to manage various pieces of state:
openDepartments: Keeps track of the open/collapsed state of department sections.
selectedDepartments: Stores the selected department IDs.
selectedSubDepartments: Stores the selected sub-department IDs.
Toggle Functions:

handleToggleDepartment: Toggles the open/collapsed state of a department section when its button is clicked.
handleToggleSubDepartment: Toggles the selection state of a sub-department checkbox. Also, when a sub-department is selected, it automatically selects its parent department if all sub-departments are selected.
handleToggleDepartmentAndSubDepartments: Handles the selection state of both departments and their sub-departments. It selects all sub-departments when a department is selected, and vice versa.
Parent Department Logic:

handleParentDepartmentSelection: Adjusts the selection state of a parent department based on the selected sub-departments. If all sub-departments of a department are selected, the parent department is selected too.
areAllSubDepartmentsSelected: Checks whether all sub-departments of a department are selected.
Rendering Departments and Sub-Departments:

The component uses the map function to iterate through the initialDepartments array and render each department along with its sub-departments.
For each department:
The ListItemButton renders a checkbox, department name, and an expand/collapse icon.
The Collapse component conditionally renders the sub-departments if the department is open.
Checkbox States and Indeterminate State:

The checkboxes of both departments and sub-departments are managed based on their selected states.
The indeterminate prop of the department checkbox shows an indeterminate state if some (but not all) sub-departments are selected.
Styling:

The component applies styles using classes from the imported CSS file DepartmentList.css.
Overall, the DepartmentList component provides a hierarchical list of departments and sub-departments with selection functionality. It handles the management of open/collapsed states, selection states, and parent/child relationships between departments and sub-departments. The styling ensures a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
